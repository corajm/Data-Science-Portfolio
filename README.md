## Projects

### Board Game Geek Predictive Modeling 
#### Group Project // September 2023 - December 2023

##### Premise
Board Game Geek (BGG) is an online forum where users can describe, discuss, and rate boardgames. Using a dataset of 20,000 Board Games (found on Kaggle), our group used ensemble learning methods to create a model to predict which types of games would recieve the highest ratings on BGG.

##### Methods
Exploratory data analysis and graphics in R Markdown, Gradient Boosting with XGBoost library, web scraping with Python and Selenium library


### Mauna Loa Time Series Analysis
#### Group Project // March 2024

##### Premise
Dr. Keeling began tracking CO2 in our atmosphere from Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii in the 1950's. This makes Keeling's data the longest recorded direct CO2 measurements from our atmosphere. Our group used time series data analysis to predict the CO2 ppm measurement for the month of April 2024.

##### Methods
Time sereis data analysis with R Markdown and itsmr library


### NYT Middle Grade Bestsellers Analysis
#### May 2023 - Ongoing

##### Premise
Many Authors' greatest goal is to get one of their books on the NYT Bestsellers list. One such middle grade author hired me to collect data from the NYT Weekly Middle Grade Hardcover best sellers list from 2015 to 2023 and analyze which sorts of books have the best chance of making it on the list. This project also led to assessing the question of "retiring" books from the list. Many authors now advocate for this, since many spots on the list are taken up by a few very popular books. 

##### Methods
Web scraping with Python, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and graphics in R Markdown


### Archive Of Our Own Web Scraping and Modeling
#### Decemeber 2023 - Ongoing

##### Premise
Archive of our Own (AO3) is a popular online website for posting original fiction and fanfiction. The site is highly organized by creator generated tags, meaning there is much data that can be scraped about each work. I Web Scraped 20,000 works from this site with the goal of using predictive analysis to see which works are most popular and using Machine Learning methods to find bot generated user interactions.

##### Methods
Web scraping with Python, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and graphics in R Markdown


### FAO Stat and NFA Enviromental Machine Learning Project
#### Group Project // Feburary 2024 - Ongoing

##### Premise
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) provides free data on the worldwide changing temperatures. We wanted to use these temperatures and time sereis data analysis to create predictive models for future temperatures, while also creating subsets of countries to predict in based on Machine Learning classification methods built off of Global Footprint Netwarks' (NFA) measurements of countries BioMass and Carbon Footprints.   

##### Methods
data cleaning, time series analysis, and classification in R Markdown, Recurent Neural Networks in Python

# Study Guides

For every math and statistics class in my college career I created a study guide. These study guides are highly decorative and combine my love for math and art. This started as a way for me to review the material and practice explaining the ideas in my own words. But my classmates found these study guides uniquely useful as well. Turning the content into an aesthetically pleasing design allowed me to make high level math and statistics feel more accessible. It also allowed me to split the content into easily digestible chunks that help the reader to understand and remember the concepts.
