 ## For every math and statistics class in my college career I created a study guide. These study guides are highly decorative and combine my love for math and art. This started as a way for me to review the material and practice explaining the ideas in my own words. But my classmates found these study guides uniquely useful as well. Turning the content into an aesthetically pleasing design allowed me to make high level math and statistics feel more accessible. It also allowed me to split the content into easily digestible chunks that help the reader to understand and remember the concepts.
